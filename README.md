# Google-Play-Store-Case-Study
In this Project I'll be showing data visualisation with the help of a case study. This will enable us to understand how visualisation aids us in solving business problems.
Here I want to develop a feature that would enable us to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app.
We can ask questions like:
Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps?
Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?
